- Lee will fill in for me in office hour and lecture next Tuesday, July 8.  I will be around that day except for office hour and lecture due to an event.

## Lecture outline:
- Solo project presentations!!
    - Tell us what your project is about.  Why did you build it?  What kind of problem are you trying to solve?
    - What stack(s) did you use?
    - What were some of the biggest challenges building it out?  Biggest triumphs?
    - What do you plan to do with your project in the future?
    - NOTE: You might feel a little envious of others or even want to go crazy mentally, especially if someone else built a feature that you wish you did.  Remember that the most important thing is your individual growth!  So do NOT compare yourself to others!
- Recursion:
    - Overview of concepts: call stack, stack overflow, base case, recursive step (forward progress)
    - Quick demos with counting down and with factorials (if there's time)
