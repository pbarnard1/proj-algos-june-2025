## Outline:
- Group project presentations!!
    - Tell us what your project is about.  Why did you build it?  What kind of problem are you trying to solve?
    - What stack(s) did you use?
    - What were some of the biggest challenges building it out?  Biggest triumphs?
    - What do you plan to do with your project in the future?
    - Demo all the main features (MVP - minimum viable product); you don't need to show your code unless you wish to do so.
    - NOTE: You might feel a little envious of others or even want to go crazy mentally, especially if someone else built a feature that you wish you did.  Remember that the most important thing is your individual growth!  So do NOT compare yourself to others!
- Final words and advice:
    - ABC - Always Be Coding
        - Keep building projects, especially ones relevant to the field you want to get into!
        - Learn new technologies!
        - Learn how to use LLMs (Language Learning Models), like Claude, OpenAI, etc.
        - Solve a few algorithm challenges a week to keep your problem-solving skills fresh!  Use sites like LeetCode (also neetcode.io), HackerRank, etc.
    - NETWORK!!
        - Go to meet-ups wherever you can
        - Find new connections and meet with them
        - Be strategic about the jobs you apply for - this is why networking is important!
    - Have fun!
