# Week 3 Thursday in Projects & Algorithms - July 3, 2025

## Announcements:
- Don't forget about this week's discussion topics and core assignments!!!  We have three core assignments this week:
    - Group Project Proposal
    - Fronts in Singly Linked Lists
    - Display in Singly Linked Lists
- To pass the course:
    - At least 5 out of 8 discussion topics
    - At least 7 out of 8 core assignments - the needed 7 MUST include ALL 4 project assignments related to your solo and group projects!
    - Working solo project (Weeks 1-2)
    - Working group project (Weeks 3-4)
- Don't forget to submit your Group Project Proposal to the platform!
- Lee will fill in for me this coming Tuesday in office hour and lecture ONLY.  I will be around before office hour that day, and I'll be available as usual the remaining days next week.
- NOTE: Friday, July 4, is a holiday!  No staff will be available that day.
- Graduation will be at 4 PM Pacific on Friday, July 18.

## Lecture outline:
- Review of mutable vs. immutable data
- Memoization (NOT memorization):
    - Fibonacci sequence without memoization
    - Fibonacci sequence with memoization
- Climbing Stairs challenge from "Recursion To Do 5"

## Useful terms to know:
- Divide and conquer - break up into smaller chunks, then solve each independently (no overlap) - usually a top-to-bottom strategy; calculations are often redone
- Dynamic programming - break up into smaller chunks, but solutions to one chunk will depend on another (overlap) - bottom-to-top strategy if using tabularization (usually iteratively with no recursion) OR top-to-bottom if using memoization (usually with recursion)
- Backtracking - solve as we go (often recursively), going back to eliminate possibilities
- Greedy algorithm - make an optimal choice at each step along the way locally without worrying about anything that comes ahead; won't always give the optimal OVERALL result
